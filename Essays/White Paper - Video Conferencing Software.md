**Executive Summary**

**Purpose of Report:**

All companies require meetings to function properly. Companies that have not previously implemented video conferencing to hold meetings have had to make that change during the current worldwide pandemic. Several services provide video conferencing such as Zoom, GoToMeeting, and Google Meet. They all have different advantages and different concerns, primarily the difference in cost, number of participants, and the levels of security available. A company must find the service that best fits their needs. Those who do so will find that the benefits of virtual meetings will extend long after the current pandemic has ended.

**Cost and number of participants:**

Zoom offers a free level of service for fewer participants (up to 3 participants for an unlimited length) or shorter meetings (up to 100 participants for less than 40 minutes). £11.99 per host per month extends the length of the meeting for up to 100 participants up to 24 hours. At £15.99 per host per month, Zoom accommodates up to 300 participants, and the enterprise tier, with a minimum of 100 hosts keeps the price per host the same but allows up to 1,000 participants.

GoToMeeting does not offer a free tier. Their lowest tier starts at £9.50 per host per month and allows up to 150 participants with unlimited meeting length. At £12.67 per host, GoToMeeting allows up to 250 participants. The enterprise tier is a customizable package and can include other options from GoToMeeting’s company that would allow up to 3,000 people to participate. 

Google Meet is only offered as part of Google’s G-Suite but does allow for basic access for free. The lowest tier costs £4.14 per host per month and can allow for up to 100 participants in the meeting. At the business tier, Google allows up to 150 participants, and the enterprise tier, at £20.00 per month allows up to 250 participants per meeting.

**Security**

Zoom utilizes transport layer security and user datagram protocol connections. Security can be better ensured with an on-premise Zoom server to store meeting data. Zoom has not yet released a transparency report.

GoToMeeting utilizes transport layer security and advanced encryption standard 256-bit algorithm encryption. Meeting permissions are set with the company-created roles.

Google Meet also supports transport layer security as well as a secure real-time transport protocol. Google recently released a transparency report outlining the company's response to government requests for customer data. Meet has anti-hijacking controls as well as long meeting codes and the ability to limit who can join a meeting.

**Findings and Conclusions**

Careful consideration as to the number of participants a company can expect and the length of expected meetings can help determine the most cost-effective plan for each service provider. All three have similar security settings, though Zoom is the only one to offer a truly secure option with their locally hosted server. Google Meet has the most transparency with company protocols.

# **Introduction**

 

 

Figure 1 COVID-19 map (COVID-19 Outbreak world map per capita, 2020).

As the world struggles amid the crisis caused by the coronavirus and the many stay-at-home orders issued around the world, we are seeing a huge shift that allows or requires employees to work from home. However, this doesn’t negate the need for communication and meetings between workers. While teleconferencing and video conferencing have been used in the past and have become a more common means of communication among staff, the current situation has dramatically increased the number of businesses that require and are utilizing these services. This paper will discuss three of the leaders in the video conferencing world: Zoom, GoToMeeting, and Google Meet. It will compare the three services in cost, the number of participants, and security.

 

# **Previous Approaches**

 

Meetings have always been an important part of any business, whether it is to provide information, make decisions or allow for discussion. In the past, these meetings were almost exclusively held in person, with each individual required to travel to a common place for these meetings, whether that was just down the hall to the conference room, or if it was around the world to meet a client in their home country. The past 50 years have seen a substantial increase in the necessity of business travel because of things like the globalization of the economy and outsourcing. “Yet travel is associated with rising costs for employers, with stress and inconvenience for travelers, and with detrimental effects on the environment” (Gustafson, 2012). 

In-person meetings have many benefits, the primary one being the stronger relationship people tend to form with an individual when meeting them face to face. Michael Massari, in an interview with Forbes Magazine, states, “Face-to-face meetings are still the most effective way to capture the attention of participants, engage them in the conversation, and drive productive collaboration” (Goman, 2016). However, with the global nature of many businesses, meeting face-to-face is not always feasible or advisable. The cost, both fiscally for attendee travel and meeting places, as well as the cost in time and added stress on those traveling, can be prohibitive.

As technology advanced, many of these meetings moved from in-person to telephone and conference calls. Telephone meetings can increase objectivity and allow participants to think more logically (Smith, n.d.). However, while these reduced the cost of in-person travel as well as the time required to do so, this doesn’t allow for non-verbal communication, such as body language, to be conveyed effectively.

Many of the disadvantages of telephone meetings can be overcome by the further advancement of video conferencing. The idea of video calling is not new, it has been around in concept since the 1870s ("The history of Video Conferencing", 2015\),  and in 1956, AT\&T created the first video call that transmitted still pictures every two seconds over telephone lines (Wolfe, 2019\). At the time, the technology was cost-prohibitive. The first widely accessible webcams were not available until 1994\. Since that time, there have been significant advancements in technology and software that have enabled almost every laptop, smartphone, and tablet to have cameras and enable them to quickly and easily adopt video messaging. This has encouraged the general population to utilize video conferencing for both personal and business needs. While there are still some obvious advantages to in-face meetings, such as the ability to touch and sample different products, video conferencing has enabled geographically dispersed teams to meet regularly and effectively without a constant need to travel.

During the current pandemic, there has been a huge increase in the adoption of remote working environments and video conferencing. One of the many available video conferencing services, Zoom, had an average daily usage of 10 million in December 2019\. By March 2020, over 200 million users were utilizing the service daily.

# **New Findings**

 

Implementing video conferencing is a necessary development for most businesses during the current worldwide pandemic. The adoption of virtual meetings can have many benefits for most businesses and the world at large during and beyond the current circumstances.

Even in areas where it is unexpected, such as physical therapy, users have been able to utilize virtual meetings to make “home visits” and increase interprofessional collaborations (Spencer, 2019). Remote visits are being utilized by physicians and medical researchers. Jan Malek stated that “remote visits are the only way we will be able to deliver health care to our aging population without financial ruin – a new-age twist on the house call of yesteryear. The same goes for clinical trials” (Malek, 2009). Other benefits, such as the ability to utilize a geographically dispersed workforce can help companies to develop teams with varied work experiences and perspectives (Neeley, 2015\). Many studies also support the idea that video conferencing is a “greener” or a more ecologically sound alternative to in-person meetings, as it reduces the carbon footprint required for travel. One study by Ong, Moors, and Sivaraman in 2014 concluded that video conferencing consumes approximately 7% of the energy cost of a physical meeting (Ong, Moors & Sivaraman, 2014).

Figure 2 Meeting Cost Comparison

Another paper, in summarizing several studies, stated that

“videoconferencing provides the possibility to interact with war-torn locations, politically unstable territories or environmental catastrophes, gives people equal access to knowledgeable experts, provides people with disabilities or other challenges the possibility to work, presents people’s views even if they are not physically or psychologically able to participate in person or simply provides a better quality of life and less polluted cities for those who spend extensive time commuting” (Ørngreen et al., 2019\).

Geographically dispersed teams, remote working, and the costs of travel all encourage the use of video conferencing to better enable work to be efficiently and economically completed.

There are a myriad of services that provide video conferencing. This paper will compare three: Zoom, GoToMeeting, and Google Meet. They all have different advantages and different concerns.

## **Cost and Number of Participants**

As with all things in business, a key comparison is the cost of the service. The primary factor in the cost is the number of hosts or organizers and the number of participants.

Figure 3 Participants and Costs Associated with Each Service

### **Zoom**

Zoom can be utilized at the basic level for free. This service allows for the hosting of up to 100 participants. One-on-one meetings are unlimited, but group meetings are limited to 40 minutes. The number of meetings the host can create is unlimited. HD video and audio are available as well as simultaneous screen sharing. Even on the basic tier, Zoom allows for breakout rooms, where meetings can be split into as many as 50 separate sessions. The “Pro” tier, at £11.99 per host per month, includes all the basic features as well as a 24-hour meeting duration limit, user management, and administrative controls. This tier includes up to 1GB of cloud recording. The next tier is the “Business” tier at £15.99 per host per month with a minimum of 10 hosts. This tier can accommodate up to 300 participants and allows for on-premise deployment, company branding as well as custom emails. The final available tier is the “Enterprise” tier at £15.99 per host per month with a minimum of 100 hosts. This can include 500 to 1,000 participants and has unlimited cloud storage.

### **GoToMeeting**

GoToMeeting does not offer a free tier to its service. The lowest tier, “Professional” starts at £9.50 per organizer per month. This allows unlimited meetings with no time limits up to 150 participants, HD video, screen sharing as well as the ability to lock a meeting. The next tier is the “Business” tier and costs £12.67 per organizer per month. This includes all the options available under the “Professional” tier but allows up to 250 participants. It also allows for Cloud recording of meetings, not taking, drawing tools and keyboard and mouse sharing.  Their final tier, the “Enterprise” level, allows for a customized package, and the ability for up to 3,000 people to participate. The cost will depend on the business needs and the package determined.

### **Google Meet**

Google Meet can only be utilized as a part of Google’s G-Suite, and basic services can also be utilized for free. For a business, however, the “Basic” tier, at £4.14 per user per month, includes business email, Hangouts Meet, Chat, 30 GB of cloud storage, and shared forms and documents. At this tier, Google Meets allows for 100 participants per call. The “Business” tier, at £8.28 per user per month allows for unlimited cloud storage and the option for up to 150 participants in video and voice conference calls. There are increased security and administration controls, such as the ability or archive or set retention policies for emails and chats. There is also a vault that allows for the retention, archival, and search of data from emails, chats, and files. The “Enterprise” tier costs £20.00 per user per month and includes up to 250 participants per call. This level has greater security features such as data loss prevention from Gmail, Google Drive and Cloud Identity Premium. This tier also creates a dial-in phone number for each meeting and allows for the recording of meetings and the ability to save them to Google Drive.

 

## **Security**

### **Zoom:**

As mentioned previously, there has been a huge rise in the number of daily users of Zoom. “However, the huge influx of users on its platform has raised a lot of issues for the company — mainly around privacy.” (Patnaik, 2020\) According to Lee and Grauer in their article in The Intercept, while Zoom states in their white paper that they have enabled end-to-end encryption, a Zoom spokesperson recently admitted that this is not possible for Zoom video meetings. They are utilizing Transport Layer Security (TLS) which encrypts communication between web applications and servers. Zoom also utilizes User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connections. This means that Zoom is using transport encryption and Zoom itself can access the unencrypted video and audio content from Zoom meetings. “So, when you have a Zoom meeting, the video and audio content will stay private from anyone spying on your Wi-Fi, but it won’t stay private from the company.” Currently, the only way to ensure that video and audio of meetings are not accessible by Zoom would be to utilize an on-premise “Meeting Connector” allowing a company to host a Zoom server on their internal corporate network (Lee & Grauer, 2020). Unlike Google, Zoom has not yet released a Transparency Report asserting its process for handling government requests for customer data.

According to the white paper recently released by the company, Zoom utilizes role-based security, allowing the host to start or schedule a meeting with a password. Hosts can also selectively invite participants or allow members from a certain domain email to join. Hosts can create an open meeting or create a password-protected one.  All presentation data can be encrypted at the application layer to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit algorithm, depending on user settings ("Zoom Security Guide", 2020).

### **GoToMeeting:**

LogMeIn, the company behind GoToMeeting, recently released a white paper dedicated to the security of their services. GoToMeeting provides “data security measures that address both passive and active attacks against confidentiality, integrity and availability” ("Web Conference Security", 2020). Like Zoom, the company utilizes the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard TLS protocols and AES 256-bit encryption to “provide protection against eavesdropping, modification or replay attacks” ("Web Conference Security", 2020). GoToMeeting has pre-set roles with set permissions, determining who can create, host, present, and attend different types of meetings. To accomplish this, they require account and session authentication. This means that to access a conference, the user must have both a GoToMeeting account, as well as access to that particular web conference. A password can also be set as an additional security measure.

### **Google Meet:**

Google’s G Suite Help lists security information for Google Meet. Like Zoom, Google Meet supports transport encryption. They adhere to IETF security standards for Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). Google recently released a Transparency Report with information on how they respond to government requests for customer data. Meet has anti-hijacking controls including 10-character long meeting codes, limiting who can join a meeting, and requiring those outside of an organization to be accepted by a member of the organization. Any participant can remove an attendee from a meeting.  Google Meet also supports 2-step Verification as well as their own Advanced Protection Programs (AAP) which protects against phishing and account hijacking. ("Google Meet security and privacy", n.d.)

 

 

## **Conclusion**

While there is still a time and a place for in-person meetings, the future is in online meetings. Companies that can switch and work effectively online will benefit, not only during the current pandemic but in the future as well.

Zoom offers video conferencing and messaging for desktops as well as mobile devices with HD video and audio. It can support up to 1,000 participants and 49 videos on a single screen. There is a 40-minute limit for groups larger than 3 people for the free tier. Meetings can be recorded and saved locally or on the cloud. Screen sharing and file sharing are both available. Security is built-in using 256-bit TLS encryption for both meetings and shared files. Scheduling can be done via Gmail, Outlook, or iCal.

GoToMeeting allows audio & video conferencing and screen sharing. The most mobile-friendly of the available options which allows the user to set up and start conference calls from their smartphone. Most features are available on the basic payment tier for up to 150 participants. 250 can participate in the business plan and allows drawing tools and mouse sharing. The Enterprise plan can accommodate up to 3,000 participants. GoToMeeting also utilized AES 256-bit encryption and standard TLS protocols.

Google Meet is included as part of G-Suites. It is a web app which means there is no software to download. Uses a dedicated dial-in number, which means that employees on the go can join in and ensures line quality and there are no dropouts. Hangouts can support chatting with up to 150 people but only 10 for video calls. Enterprise-level features allow meetings up to 250 people and recording on Google Drive. There is a dedicated app as well as the ability to work with existing conferencing hardware such as Skype for Business. Like Zoom and GoToMeeting, Meet uses TLS protocols and AES 256-bit encryption. Google is the most transparent in its security and reporting policies.

Each of these services can be beneficial to those businesses that are turning to remote workers and online meetings to continue their businesses during this global pandemic. Which service is selected will be based primarily on the business’s requirements for hosts and participants.
