**Collaborate Presentation on the Employment of Women in World War II**  
For the collaborative project, the group chose the topic of women’s employment in World War II. This topic was chosen as it was central to changing public opinion about women in the workforce. While women have always worked, and often outside of the home, it wasn’t until World War II that they were tentatively accepted *en masse* into traditionally male-dominated fields. Even though they were allowed to take these jobs, they still faced many challenges such as discrimination, harassment, and unequal pay. After the war, these women were often fired and discarded, but they had proven they could take on these challenges and succeed. This led the way for second-wave feminism to take a more definitive stance for women’s rights and equality. This paper will discuss some of the many struggles these women faced and how these struggles lead to changes that have advanced the rights for women.

**Prior to World War II**  
	Prior to World War II, women were a part of the workforce, but only really allowed to participate in “women’s work” and a great many of them were from minority groups or lower working class families. Women were often nannies, cooks or housekeepers. During the Great Depression, laws were enacted that further limited women’s rights. For example, in 1924, New York passed a law prohibiting women from working the night shift in restaurants and clubs. In 1932, the National Recovery Act only allowed one family member to hold a government job. The effect of this was to kick out many of the women who had worked for the government and allowed the male head of household to retain his job (Wolfe, 2019, section 7 & 8). Women, especially middle-class women, were actively discouraged from working outside of the home. Many believed that to do so took work away from men who should rightfully have those jobs.  
Since World War II, women have continued to struggle with the social expectation that they should stay home and be satisfied and fulfilled by their contributions to their home and family. Yet, these contributions are so often looked down upon and not respected. As stated in the class reading:  
Men have always had servants (us) to take care of the bottom strata of life while they have confined their efforts to the rarefied upper regions. It is thus ironic when they ask of women—where are your great painters, statesmen, etc. Mme. Matisse ran a millinery shop so he could paint. Mrs. Martin Luther King kept his house and raised his babies (Morgan, 1970).”   
Though there has been improvement, studies show that housework is still not divided evenly, even when the woman works the same hours as the man (Lachance-Grzela, M., & Bouchard, G., 2010, p 767–780). Society is more accepting of women in the workforce now than it was during World War II, but there is a long way to go to reach true equality among the sexes.

**Women in the Military in World War II**   
During World War II, as the men left for the front lines, the women were left behind and became a major contributing force in the workforce. Five million more women entered the workforce between 1940 and 1945 (Corbett, et al, 2019, section 27.2). Many women wanted to support the military. In fact, 350,000 women joined the Armed Services during this time. In 1942, the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps, later known as the Women’s Army Corps, was created. In the Navy, they joined the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service or WAVES groups. The Coast Guard and Marine Corps also had women’s groups. Women had an important impact on the Air Force through the Women’s Airforce Service Pilots or WASPs. These women flew more than 60 million miles during the war ("American Women in World War II", n.d., para. 2). While women were not allowed at the front lines, their work as nurses in the Army and Navy Medical Corps would often bring them quite close (Women in the Military, n.d., Overview). These women made a large impact on the war, and on the acceptance of women into the armed forces.  
The work of these women led President Harry Truman to push for change, and the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act was passed in 1948.This allowed women to serve as permanent, regular members of the Armed Forces (Bellafaire, 2017, “The Women’s Armed Services Integration Act”). Women are still fighting for their right to serve and respect when they do so. It was only in 2016 that women were allowed to be assigned to combat positions (Blakemore, 2018, para. 18). In 2018, women only represent 16% of the enlisted forces and 18% of the officers corps (Reynolds & Shendruk, 2018, “How Diverse is the Military”). As much as two thirds of the women in the military have faced discrimination and sexual harassment (Oppenheim, 2019, para. 1). Women have made great strides in their ability to fight for their country and there are still many battles to be fought to allow them to do so without harassment and abuse from their male counterparts.

**Women in the Workforce During World War II and Their Modern Day Counterparts**  
In 1939 there was a shortage of able-bodied men as they left for the front lines and the country was gearing up for war. The government decided there needed to be a change in the cultural perceptions of women who worked outside of the home. Extensive propaganda campaigns were started, emphasizing patriotism and the need to “Do your part\!” for the war efforts (Social Education, 1994, p. 94). Women began working in factory jobs, defense plants, and offices. They took work as taxi drivers, construction workers, and firefighters. Many more worked or volunteered at farms as manual labor. However, when the war was over, these women who had kept America going and supported their families and their country, were fired or encouraged to leave their jobs to allow for returning veterans (“Gender Roles In A Post-War America", 2013, para. 4).” It was during this time, as stated in Module 4, that a real tug of war was being held. Women were expected to meekly return home. However, there were many who were still fighting for to end discrimination and bring about equal pay.   
Today, women are still pushed aside in favor of their male counterparts. “Around the world, finding a job is more difficult for women than it is for men. Women are still less likely to be hired for jobs than men, even with the same qualifications (Gerdeman, 2017, para. 1). When women are employed, they tend to work in low-quality jobs in vulnerable conditions, and there is little improvement forecast in the near future ("The gender gap in employment: What's holding women back?", 2018, para. 1).” While the wage gap has shrunk, there are those who say it will take more than two *centuries* before it is closed (Treanor, 2017, para. 1). As far as we have come, women are still struggling to find their own way in work environments that are all-too-often male dominated.  
These strong women were willing to buck tradition and work in male-dominated fields. They continued to push to keep the rights that came with those responsibilities. Because of them,  the Women’s Rights movement was able to move forward in the 1950s and 1960s. Our grandmothers and great-grandmothers paved the way for their children, showing them that women were capable and qualified to take on positions outside of the stereotypical “female” jobs such as being a maid or seamstress. We owe them a great debt that can only be repaid by continuing the fight for freedom from oppression and equality among the sexes.

**Group Presentation Dynamic**  
	For our particular group, working together was a struggle. Our group consisted of Riana Franklin Allen (me), Latisha McIntosh, and Elizabeth Watson. Elizabeth and I live about a block apart and are friends, so we determined to do the project together. We held a meeting, decided on a topic, and had a brainstorming session. Latisha was added about a week later when she did not self-select into a group. Elizabeth and I worked to fill her in and set up times to work together as a group, as we were working with a five-hour time difference. She failed to join, comment or submit ideas during this process. As a group, we set several deadlines: first, to have an outline and then, to have the slides completed for our presentation. Latisha stated several times that she was having problems (internet, laptop, access and personal problems), but told us that the work was done.   
On the Tuesday before the assignment was due we had not received any work from Latisha. After discussing with Elizabeth, I told Latisha that if she was not able to do the work, please let Elizabeth and I do it. She said I threatened her at which time I contacted the professor. Upon reflection, I can see how she felt threatened when we let her know we intended to complete the project with or without her contributions.. However that was not my intent; I just wanted the work done. She said she would have her work within 30 minutes. After several hours, it still wasn't submitted. She did finally submit some work, but it was not relevant to the subject and needed to be reworked. I was consistently checking in with her over the next several days, asking for her to fix, change, or submit information. Finally, very early on Sunday morning, well after a delayed deadline, which she disregarded, and six hours after the two-hour extension she requested to do the work, she did submit her work. I still had to correct some of the work before I was comfortable that it was ready to submit. In the end, however, she did submit some work. And unfortunately, these types of situations with miscommunication and lack of cohesion happen in groups and cannot always be avoided.   
Latisha used many excuses, including personal struggles to explain why her work was not completed on time. I understand that personal difficulties happen. Elizabeth had surgery in the middle of this project and was laid up with the flu for several additional days, but always managed to get her work done. In all my interactions with my group, I tried to remain level-headed, respectful, and understanding. However, Latisha’s actions caused me quite a bit more work than if I had simply done the slides myself and infinitely more stress. I am taking ten credits this 8-week cycle and had a different final on Saturday while trying to interact with her. I had an actual panic attack on Saturday and have been having chest pain since then. I also have 5 kids and a job but dealing with her was the most stressful thing that I have done over the last several weeks..   
Unfortunately, I feel like this is one reason why female employees get the bad reputation that they sometimes do. There are women who use their family obligations or the struggle of balancing life as an excuse for not meeting their obligations outside of the home. One rarely hears men complaining about their home life affecting their work or school. Often, it is the reverse, their work or school has a greater effect on their home life. If I were a hiring manager and had more than a few women who used these types of excuses, I would also be hesitant to hire other women. Not all women do this, thankfully, and hopefully those who do manage to balance home life with school, work and other responsibilities can do the additional work to overcome those stereotypes. Also, as men step up more and more in the home environment, more women will be able to better manage the balancing act that is necessary to dedicate to their family and career.

**Group Contributions**  
In our group, Elizabeth and I worked together to create an outline and a notes document to reference when putting together the presentation and working on our individual papers. For the presentation, Latisha worked on the economic impact (slides 5-7), political impact (slides 15-17), and one slide on the Equal Pay Act (slide 23). Elizabeth did the social impact (slides 8-10) and cultural impact (slides 11-14). I took on the introduction (slides 1-4), relation to current issues (slides 18-20), the conclusion (slides 21-22, and 24). I also put together the reference information (slides 25-27) with references given by each participant. 

**Lessons Learned from an Introduction to Women’s Studies**  
This course was quite eye-opening for me. It gave me words for things that I have been feeling for a really long time in my life. Reading the excerpt from Betty Friedan of the *Feminine Mystique* was like taking a looking glass to my life. I have been a stay-at-home-mother, looking for fulfillment as I “made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with \[my\] children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, \[and\] lay beside \[my\] husband at night (Friedan, 1963, p. 15).” I was told that should be enough, that it was for “everyone else.” Most of all, I was told that wanting more was selfish. Reading Friedan’s work from 1963 made me realize I was not alone in my experiences and some of the struggles I have faced have been ongoing for generations.  
The readings for this class made me look harder at feminism, racism, homophobia, ageism and the many other ways in which we discriminate against each other. Often we are guilty of trying to make us “normal” and them “other.” Before this class, I thought women were doing okay; maybe not great, but okay. After doing the research for the many discussion questions and projects, I have come to realize how far we are from finding the equality that we need. Around the globe women are discriminated against, abused and treated as property. Even in the “civilized” world, we are far from the seeing the equity that we would want for ourselves or for our children. We can do better. We should do better.  
Watching Sheryl Sandberg’s TED talk made me realize how often we, as women, step back when we should be stepping up and leaning in (Sandberg, 2010). It has made me even more concerned as I look at going back to the workforce with an eye towards being able to better help support myself and my family. The research I did on the wage gap, the hiring gap, discrimination and the biases that dominate many fields makes me concerned for myself and for my children. I am completing a degree in Computer Science, but research indicates that women leave tech fields at a rate 45 percent higher than men, often because of discrimination and harassment (Florentine, 2018, para. 1). I know that these are challenges that I will face in the near future. However, I also know I will not be alone in fighting for equality. There are many groups specifically for women in technical fields, reaching out and helping each other to succeed. Women have proven that we are all better when we work together. This class taught me that, while we have a ways to go, we are heading in the right direction and we are moving that way together.
