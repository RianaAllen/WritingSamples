## Introduction
With the spread of Covid-19 and the Coronavirus, more people are in self-isolation than ever 
before. This leaves many people, especially our older generation, in a bit of a quandary if 
they have relied on the local pubs and cafes for some or all their meals. The elderly are 
also the most likely to struggle with technology and how it can benefit them. This is a set 
of simple instructions meant to help the most basic user create an account, log in, and find 
a restaurant from one of the most popular food delivery apps in the United Kingdom, Just Eat.
