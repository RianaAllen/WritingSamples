# The Faces in Cases

Once upon a time, long, long ago there was a simple farmer. The farmer lived in the land of the king and his queen and the prince and his princess.

For long years, as he tilled and he plowed, he gazed longingly at all the king and the prince and all they possessed. He would sit in his humble shack, watching through the window as the royals pranced and partied and played without a single glance in the farmer's direction.

He sat and grumbled and mumbled and thought, "Why, I'm as good as those fancy folk\! If they would just look past my humble facade, they would see\!"

And so, the farmer dug up some earth and made himself some clay. He worked it and smoothed it and creased it and soon, soon he had a most dignified of masks. He put on his best clothes, even better than his favorite overalls, and wandered into one of the parties that were so frequently held at the palace. And the mask was so good, the royals accepted him as one of their own. And he danced and partied all night.

But when he came home, the clay had dried to his face. A little skin and a little pain, and he had pried the mask off.

As he woke the next morning and remembered the best night he had ever had, he thought, "I must do that again\!" So the next night he attended again. And the next. And he was happy for a moment.

Soon, he caught sight of a beautiful guest. And as he watched her, he heard her say to her friend, "Oh, have you seen the new man that's come? I do wish he were a touch taller, and that nose, oh my\!" And they, giggling, turned and walked away none the wiser to his eavesdropping.

And so, the farmer dug up some earth and made himself some clay. He worked it and smoothed it and creased it and soon, soon he had a most dignified of masks with a long and thin nose. He made himself some stilts for his shoes. He placed the first mask in a case and the next night off he went with a new face and a new character to play. He confidently asked the beautiful guest to dance, and she said yes. They danced the night away, and he was happy for a moment.  
He came home and pried the mask off with even greater effort than the first.

But then he saw another guest, even more beautiful than the last. As he neared her, he heard her say to her friends, "Oh, I do so love a gentleman that lovely mustache, don't you?"

Once again at home, the farmer pried the mask away with still greater effort, placing it in a case. Then the farmer dug up some earth and made himself some clay. He worked it and smoothed it and creased it and soon, soon he had a most dignified of masks with such a grandiose mustache. And the next night, off he went with a new face and a new character to play. He asked the beautiful lady to dance, and she said yes. They danced the night away. And he was happy for a moment.

But each night, he found a guest, always more lovely than the last. Each night he pried off the most recent mask and placed it in a case. And each day he dug up some earth and made himself some clay. He worked it and smoothed and creased it, and soon he had a new face and a new character to play.

What he hadn't realized was that as he was digging and smoothing and playing, his farm was suffering and withering from lack of attention. And each mask he wore, as he pried it off, took a bit more of his own face away. But each night he would pry away the mask of the day and each day he would create a new face and a new character to play.

Until one day, as he joked with his most beautiful of companions, she tapped his cheek in jest. And what should happen, but the mask should crack\! All those gathered around gasped as the mask crumbled to dust and they stared in amazement. For what was left was barely a face at all, it was smoothed of all character and had lost all depth. All of the ladies shrieked in horror and one even fainted at the sight of a man with no face\!

The poor farmer ran from the gathering, desperately trying to cover what remained of his visage. Away he ran, back to his farm, or what was left of it. He looked around and only saw holes dug throughout and nothing planted for ages. The ground was scarred and pitted.

He ran past the pockmarked fields to his humble home. But his home was no longer a home. Instead, it was so full of the cases holding his faces there was no longer room for him. Only a testament to the many characters he played.

And there he stood, surrounded by his ruined fields, a face so lost to the ravages of ripping character after character away. He saw his home, filled to overflowing with cases of faces...

And realized how empty he had become.
