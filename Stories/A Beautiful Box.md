# A Beautiful Box

Once upon a time, long, long ago there was a girl. And the girl felt big things.

Watching a sunrise could make the girl feel so elated she felt she could fly. A waterfall could bring her to tears of appreciation. The birds' song in the morning could make her heart ache. And the touch of her hand could make her whole body tremble.

But not all big feelings are happy feelings. Just as she could embrace the ecstatic joys of life, the pains and sorrows affected her just as greatly.

A wounded animal would make her sob. The trials of a friend would make her ache to comfort them. And heartbreak would destroy her.

As the girl grew, she learned that sometimes big feelings just hurt too much, both the highs and the lows. She learned that others didn't like that she felt so much, it made them uncomfortable. She learned that still others would use those emotions and hurt her with them. And she learned that a select few would wallow in those feelings for their own enjoyment.

So the girl built a box. It was a pretty box, with gold hinges and a beautiful inlaid pattern. When the girl started to feel her feelings were too big, she would put them in the box. When her heart would ache for the sorrows around her, she would take the feelings from her heart and put them in the box. When the tears would spill from an overabundance of happiness, she would take those tears from her eyes and put them in the box.

And sometimes, when she had time, and when she was alone, she would pull out a feeling, and welcome it, the good feelings and the bad. She would fully embrace the feeling and then, when she had taken a moment to fully feel, she would let the feeling go and it would flutter away.

But soon, the box became too full. And when she would open it to put in the new feelings, other feelings would start to slip out. For feelings are never meant to be kept in a box. They are meant to be felt and embraced and enjoyed and suffered and then released. But there were too many. And they were too big. And it became too much.

By then the box was too full. There were too many feelings locked away. Too many emotions, all mixed and twisted and fused. The girl could no longer pick out one at a time, as they had grown together like the roots of a plant in a too-small pot.

And she no longer had a place for the big emotions that still came to her, still overwhelmed her, and encompassed her.

And the girl knew... Some day soon, the lid would no longer contain all the feelings she had placed in the box. And the feelings would need their moment. Soon, she would be at the mercy of those emotions she had thought so cleverly to box up and put away.
